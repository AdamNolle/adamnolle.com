        <strong>Hey! üëã</strong>
          <p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my website and learn a little about me. So first let me introduce myself. My name is Adam Nolle. I am currently a Senior at Missouri University of Science and Technology (or Missouri S&T). 
            I am studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering. From January 2023 to May I was the President of my school's <a href="https://www.mstacm.org/">ACM</a> 
            (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter. In my time as President I brought back our annual MegaMiner event, helped to renovate the second floor CS lounge in our school‚Äôs computer Science building, 
            and developed a Shopify merch shop and more!</p>      
          <br>
          <p>Currently I am now the ACM Web Chair and also helping to lead ACM's new Development team. With ACM Web I am leading a group of students to develop a new ACM Website, and with Development I am working on phasing out 
            our old server infrastructure with some cool new stuff funded by the school!</p>

        <strong>(Content) Creator üé®</strong> 
          <p>I love creating things, specifically digital ‚Äúcontent‚Äù online for people to enjoy and learn from. The place where I put most of my creative time is my YouTube channel which is linked in the nav bar above! I love making videos on things that catch my attention and have made it into a fun hobby for me to do. On top of this I also have my blog ‚ÄúRAMdom Thought‚Äù where I just talked about anything that comes to mind that I think is interesting to either ponder upon or just talk about. I host my blog on Substack and if you‚Äôd liked you are more than welcome to subscribe for free!<p>

        <strong>Tech Nerd ü§ì</strong> 
        <p>I really love all things computers ... it's true. I am really big into 3D printing for example and think it's a ton of fun to bring ideas into the real world and 3D printing makes that super easy. On top of that I just love messing with computers and servers. I have my own little UNRAID NAS I run for my family at home and have helped many people spec out a build PC's!</p>

        <strong>Music Enjoyer üé∂</strong> 
          <p>I enjoy music as most people do üòÖ. Recently I have started collecting vinyls of some of my favorite albums (üí∏) along with CD‚Äôs as well. I really enjoy the experience of playing vinyls. It really makes listening to music a more engaging experience. I also like collecting CDs for when I want to listen to physical music and support artists. They are also much cheaper than vinyls ‚Ä¶.<p> 
          <br>
          <p>I also enjoy making beats in FL Studio and Logic, a hobby I picked up over the summer of 2023. I haven‚Äôt started posting them yet but if I do I will be sure to link it here!<p>
