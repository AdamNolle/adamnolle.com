## My personal website.

- This is all the code and files for my website.
- This website is a continuing project meaning I will try to maintain and keep it updated as time goes on, with no schedule just whenever I want to make additions or changes to the site.

# Development

#### Some things I have in making the website, or things I thought would be cool to share.

### Coding

- For the blog, I used cards from the Bootstrap framework [found here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/). Doing this made it look easier to make a nice little landing page for each post. *This is a solid starting point, but I want to revise my blog in the future.*
- This was a <u><span>major</span></u> help in figuring out how to make the bouncing icon animation behind my profile picture on the homepage. I was able to do this by using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j86zuqqTlQ). Very energetic and fun video by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) (links to website) I do recommend.

### Media

- For the profile picture of myself that sits on the homepage, I used this website: [Profile Picture Maker](https://profilepicturemaker.com/). I used this to create the circular outline and green border.

### Servers

- I learned a lot about self-hosting doing this project two things I have worked with are Raspberry Pi and an old Chrombox.

- **Raspberry Pi:** If you self-host a website it's always a good idea to have a static IP [here is the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCJtUbRlIXE) I used to do that on a Raspberry Pi. If you plan on using a Raspberry Pi this is a fantastic and quick tutorial on setting up an [Apache Web Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwQd3OpADNo&list=PLb57qDyElIYUq33uvYXzWs5n7GyeKrEjj&index=10) (this also works for the Chromebox option).

- **Chrombox:** [This is a fantastic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t4upBIKxUo) for rooting a Chrombox and installing your Linux OS of choice. Be aware the process of rooting a Chromebox can be different for every model so be patient and research how to do it. It is a fun project and gives more functionality to an old Chromebox! Raspberry Pi tutorial for [Apache Web Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwQd3OpADNo&list=PLb57qDyElIYUq33uvYXzWs5n7GyeKrEjj&index=10) still works just ignore the first few steps about setting up and flashing a Pi which is where the aforementioned tutorial comes in.
