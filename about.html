        <strong>Hey! 👋</strong>
          <p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my website and learn a little about me. So first let me introduce myself. My name is Adam Nolle. I am currently a Senior at Missouri University of Science and Technology (or Missouri S&T). I am studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Since Spring of 2023 I have been the President of my school's <a href="https://www.mstacm.org/">ACM</a> (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter. In my time as President I have brought back our annual MegaMiner event, helped to renovate the second floor CS lounge in our school’s computer Science building, and developed a Shopify merch shop and more!</p>

        <strong>(Content) Creator 🎨</strong> 
          <p>I love creating things, specifically digital “content” online for people to enjoy and learn from. The place where I put most of my creative time is my YouTube channel which is linked in the nav bar above! I love making videos on things that catch my attention and have made it into a fun hobby for me to do.<p> 
          <br>
          <p> On top of this I also have my blog “RAMdom Thought” where I just talked about anything that comes to mind that I think is interesting to either ponder upon or just talk about. I host my blog on Substack and if you’d liked you are more than welcome to subscribe for free!<p> 
          <br>
          <p>Finally I also have a podcast! 🎧 For topics that I want to dive into a lot of detail into that I don’t think I convey in either a video or a blog post that is what my podcast is for. I don’t find talking for long periods of time to be too hard of a task anyways 😂. Also I figured if I had a YouTube channel and a blog I had to round it out with a podcast as well.<p>

        <strong>Tech Nerd 🤓</strong> 
        <p>I really love all things computers ... it's true. I am really big into 3D printing for example and think it's a ton of fun to bring ideas into the real world and 3D printing makes that super easy. On top of that I just love messing with computers and servers. I have my own little UNRAID NAS I run for my family at home and have helped many people spec out a build PC's!</p>

        <strong>Music Enjoyer 🎶</strong> 
          <p>I enjoy music as most people do 😅. Recently I have started collecting vinyls of some of my favorite albums (💸) along with CD’s as well. I really enjoy the experience of playing vinyls. It really makes listening to music a more engaging experience. I also like collecting CDs for when I want to listen to physical music and support artists. They are also much cheaper than vinyls ….<p> 
          <br>
          <p>I also enjoy making beats in FL Studio, a hobby I picked up over the summer of 2023. I haven’t started posting them yet but if I do I will be sure to link it here!<p>
